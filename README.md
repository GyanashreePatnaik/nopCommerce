In this project, I explored the main features of the nopCommerce frontend application, which is an open-source eCommerce platform. I focused on understanding how different parts like product browsing, cart operations, and the order process work together to deliver a complete online shopping experience through manual testing.

Key Activities:

Test Scenario Design: I created user-focused test scenarios to help guide the testing process. Each scenario represented a user journey across different areas of the platform.

Test Case Writing: From these scenarios, I developed step-by-step test cases that ensured all core functionalities were covered â€” including login, registration, product navigation, and orders process.

Manual Testing: I manually executed each test case, checking that every feature worked as expected and identifying any usability or functional issues in the process.

Bug Logging and Reporting: Any unexpected behavior or defects I found were documented in Excel.

Reporting: I prepared test execution reports and bug summaries to clearly show what was tested and what issues were found during the process.

Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in testing eCommerce platforms. It helped me improve my skills in writing test cases, executing manual tests, and reporting bugs.
